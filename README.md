## Install 

To install the Violet Pool Controller via HACS, follow these steps:

    Open HACS in your Home Assistant interface.
    Click on the three dots in the top-right corner.
    Select "Custom repositories" from the dropdown menu.
    Add the following URL as a custom Git repository:
    https://github.com/Xerolux/violet-hass.git
    Choose "Integration" as the category for the repository.
    Once the repository is added, go to "Integrations" in HACS.
    Search for "Violet Pool Controller" and download the integration.
    Restart Home Assistant to apply the changes.
    After restarting, navigate to Settings > Integrations and add the "Violet Pool Controller" integration.


## Configuration is done in the UI

Configure the IP address to match your pool controller (e.g., http://192.168.x.xxx/getReadings?ALL).

Optionally, adjust the polling frequency for fetching data. However, remember that Violet itself only updates data every 10 seconds.

## A brief description of the Violet Pool Controller

![Violet Home Assistant Integration][pbuy]

VIOLET is designed as a smart all-in-one solution for pool control, capable of managing smaller pool installations, such as just the filtration, heating/solar heating, and lighting control (ON/OFF or DMX-enabled), as well as offering a comprehensive solution for fully equipped pools by controlling all typical additional components like backwashing, overflow tank control (for infinity pools), water level regulation (for skimmer pools), pool cover, additional water features, and, of course, dosing. All functions work intelligently together when necessary to provide a logical and efficient control of the entire pool system. In case of errors (e.g., sensor failure, filter pump running dry, faulty refill valve, emptying dosing canisters, and much more), notifications can be sent via email, push, or HTTP request to enable timely and targeted action without having to constantly monitor individual devices or fill levels on-site.

The configuration and operation of VIOLET are entirely browser-based (web app) and can be accessed using any PC, Mac, tablet, or smartphone. Integrated statistics (with data export for any time period in Excel-compatible format), a log file that records all switching actions and configuration changes, remote access functionality (allowing access to VIOLET from anywhere in the world), and many other features round out the systemâ€™s capabilities. For easy integration of VIOLET into home automation systems or smart homes (such as ioBroker, Loxone, KNX, FHEM, IP-Symcon), all measurements and switching states can be accessed via a simple JSON API.
