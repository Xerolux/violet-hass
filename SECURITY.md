# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

It is recommended to always use the most recent release version of the software.  
No security updates or patches will be provided for outdated releases.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you identify a vulnerability, please keep in mind that it could affect other users or projects. Therefore, before making the vulnerability public (e.g., via a GitHub issue), kindly email me at [Xerolux](mailto:git@xerolux.de) to give me the opportunity to address and fix the issue before it could potentially be misused by a third party.
