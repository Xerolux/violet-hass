   - Remove shell command integrations
   - Clean up old automation triggers

2. **Install integration:**
   - Follow installation guide in README
   - Use same IP address and credentials
   - Select equivalent features

3. **Update automations:**
   - Replace REST calls with service calls
   - Update entity names (old: `sensor.pool_temp` → new: `sensor.violet_pool_temperature`)
   - Use new blueprints for common scenarios

### From Beta Versions
Beta testers should:
1. Remove beta installation completely
2. Install stable release via HACS
3. Reconfigure with same settings
4. Update any custom automations
